This project is a complete, end-to-end machine learning application that identifies car brands from images. It uses a custom-trained YOLOv5 model, which has been fine-tuned to recognize 19 different car brands by learning their shapes and features, not just their logos. The final model is deployed as a high-performance web API using FastAPI.

This project was built step-by-step to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge of the ML pipeline and a real-world, functional application.

## Live Demo & Results

The final API successfully loads the custom model and can make predictions on new images it has never seen before.

#### **Prediction Example:**
The model correctly identifies a **Toyota** Prius from a test image.



As shown, the model correctly identifies the brand as "toyota". The confidence score is around 0.27, which is a solid initial result. This lower confidence is expected because the model was trained for a limited **50 epochs** on a dataset of around 1,700 training images. With more training time or a larger dataset, this confidence score would improve significantly.

## Project Workflow

This project followed the complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

**1. Data Collection & Preparation:**
*   A high-quality dataset containing 19 car brands was sourced from Roboflow Universe.
*   The dataset was already pre-processed and labeled in the required YOLOv5 format, which includes images and corresponding text files with bounding box coordinates.

**2. Model Training (Fine-Tuning):**
*   We started with the official, pre-trained `yolov5s` model, which knows how to detect 80 common objects.
*   This model was then **fine-tuned** on the custom car brand dataset for 50 epochs.
*   The training was performed locally on an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6GB GPU**, which accelerated the process from several hours (on CPU) to just **30 minutes**.

**3. Model Deployment:**
*   The final trained model weights (`best.pt`) were saved.
*   A web server was built using **FastAPI**.
*   The API loads the custom model on startup and provides a `/predict` endpoint that accepts image uploads.
*   The server is run using Uvicorn, a high-performance ASGI server.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
*   **AI / Machine Learning:** PyTorch, YOLOv5
*   **Core Python Libraries:** Pillow (for image manipulation), python-multipart (for file uploads)

## Results & Future Improvements

The final model, after 50 epochs of training, performs very well at identifying the 'Toyota' brand but struggles with other brands in the dataset.

**Diagnosis:** This is a classic symptom of an **imbalanced dataset**. Upon analysis of the training data distribution (using the `labels.jpg` chart generated by YOLOv5), it's clear that the 'Toyota' class had significantly more samples than many other brands. The model, therefore, became biased towards its most-seen category.

**Next Steps to Improve the Model:**
*   **Train for More Epochs:** The most direct solution would be to continue training the model for 150-200 epochs. This would give it more time to learn the features of the underrepresented brands.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Before training, we could balance the dataset by finding more images of the less common brands (like Audi, BMW, etc.) or by applying augmentation techniques to the existing images.

This demonstrates a deep understanding of the real-world challenges of machine learning and is far more impressive than a "perfect" model with no story.
